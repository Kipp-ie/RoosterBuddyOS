# RoosterBuddyOS
Our idea:
- An easy device for seeing your class schedules.
- Battery powered so it needs to be energy efficient.

Why did we come with this idea?:
We are Dutch (So from the Netherlands). At the begin of 2024 the dutch government decided to ban all mobile devices from schools. It was really a pain in the butt because all our schedules were digital so we came up with the idea to make a small device that could refresh your class schedule on a screen.

Our goal:
Create a small battery powered device with a raspberry pi pico and a screen.

How will we achieve this goal?
Making alot of prototypes. Dipping our toes in C++ on pi pico. And also by having fun :)

What will we need?
- A screen
- Raspberry Pi Pico W

What components we got up with:
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- 2.9 Inch E-Ink display (Battery efficient)
- Small lipo battery
- 3D printed case (Will get the p1S at my bday :D)
- Usb-C port for charging.
maybe more components later.

(Not the best sketch but you should get the idea :)
